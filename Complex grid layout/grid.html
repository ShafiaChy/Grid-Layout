            <h1>A Complete Guide to CSS Grid</h1>
            <p>
              CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), is a two-dimensional
              grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system
              of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces.
              CSS has always been used to layout our web pages, but it is never
              done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats,
              positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were
              essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality
              (vertical centering, for instance).

            <h1>CSS Grid Basics</h1>
            <p>
              To get started you have to define a container element as a grid
              with display: grid, set the column and row sizes with
              grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its
              child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.
              Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items does not
              matter. Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super
              easy to rearrange your grid with media queries. introduced.

              Before diving into the concepts of Grid it is important to
              understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are all
              kinda conceptually similar, it is easy to confuse them with one
              another if you do not first memorize their meanings defined by the
              Grid specification. But do not worry, there are not many of them.

            Notice that you are not naming lines with this syntax, just areas.
            When you use this syntax the lines on either end of the areas are
            actually getting named automatically. If the name of your grid area
            is foo, the name of the area starting row line and starting column
            line will be foo-start, and the name of its last row line and last
            column line will be foo-end. This means that some lines might have
            multiple names, such as the far left line in the above example,
            which will have three names: header-start, main-start, and
            footer-start.
